# Pub_Golf

Hi all,

It may seem like I'm planning this a bit early. That's because I am planning this a bit early. Anyways, my birthday is next month but it's not just any old birthday; it's a REAL BIRTHDAY! The 29th of Feb is upon us. I am not as privileged as most of the world to have a birthday every year so I'm going to make this one extra special. Listen up - here's the plan:

Golf. Golf. Golf. 

I'm going to book swingers mini-golf in the late lunchtime for anyone who fancies getting lucky with balls and holes.
For anyone who wants to continue the celebrations I have prepared a plan for Pub Golf (rules found [here] (https://www.pubgolfguide.com/pub-golf-rules/) I will be providing the scorecards and pencils.
Dress code: golf attire (I'll Just be wearing chinos and a polo shirt lol)
Swingers is Â£13 a person for a round. There is a bar upstairs once we finish.
Please remember to blow your nose beforehand as we don't want any bogies. Birdies are more than welcome ðŸ˜‰
I'll be bringing a spare pair of pants as I know I'll be getting a hole-in-one!

Who's in?
