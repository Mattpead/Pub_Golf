## what is the reason (for all this?)

Hi all,

It may seem like I'm planning this a bit early. That's because I am planning this a bit early. Anyways, my birthday is next month but it's not just any old birthday; it's a REAL BIRTHDAY! The 29th of Feb is upon us. I am not as privileged as most of the world to have a birthday every year so I'm going to make this one extra special. Listen up - here's the plan:

## Golf. Golf. Golf. 

I'm going to book swingers mini-golf in the late lunchtime for anyone who fancies getting lucky with balls and holes.
For anyone who wants to continue the celebrations I have prepared a plan for Pub Golf rules found [here](https://www.pubgolfguide.com/pub-golf-rules/) I will be providing scorecards and pencils. Please share the link to anyone who fancies joining in on the pub golf! 

Please remember to blow your nose beforehand as we don't want any bogies. Birdies are more than welcome ðŸ˜‰
I'll be bringing a spare pair of pants as I know I'll be getting a hole-in-one!

## Dress code

Golf attire (I'll Just be wearing chinos and a polo shirt lol)
